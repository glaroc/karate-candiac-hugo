    - name: Sensei Mélanie Rochon
      image: images/senseis/Melanie.jpg
      designation: Black belt, 3rd dan
      content: I started karate at the age of 9 in 1987, at the Candiac karate school. As a brown belt, I enrolled in another Shotokan-style school and have been practising both styles ever since. In 1997, I started teaching and sharing my passion, and in 1999, I obtained my black belt. Since then, I've never stopped practising karate, and I intend to continue for as long as possible. In addition to giving me a black belt and a second family, karate has taught me to surpass myself, persevere and respect others.

    - name: Sensei Yannick Preziuso
      image: images/senseis/Yannick.jpg
      designation: Black belt, 1st dan
      content: "I started karate at the age of 11 at the Candiac karate school with Normand Théoret sensei. He was my teacher for many years. I took a 13-year break from karate, and after all those years I resumed classes, finally earning my black belt in 2013. I've been teaching him ever since. In 2010, during the summer, I practiced a few techniques with Stephan Quiblat sensei. I'm currently doing two black belt martial arts styles: Shorin ryu and KyokuShin Kai in a private school I've been attending since 2012 to further improve my skills with Stéphane Giroux sensei. I like fighting, I'm perseverant and disciplined. I hope to pursue karate for as long as my sensei Normand Théoret, whom I respect enormously."

    - name: Sensei Daniel Tilli
      image: images/senseis/Daniel.jpg
      designation: Black belt, 1st dan
      content: From an early age, I've been very active, starting karate at the age of 6 with sensei Normand Théoret, and practising relentlessly until I obtained my black belt in 1997. A few years later, life led me to take up other sports on a regular basis (climbing, running, road biking, cross-country skiing), and with full-time studies and work, I took a 17-year break. I've been back for several years now, and it motivates me to see the young people and adults who come back year after year with the same motivation I have for this great sport and lifestyle.

    - name: Sensei François Martel
      image: images/senseis/Francois.jpg
      designation: Black belt, 1st dan
      content: "I've loved martial arts since I was very young. I practised judo for several years until I obtained my blue belt. In 2002, my son and I signed up for karate at the town of Candiac in the parent-child group. I then continued with the adult group until I obtained my black belt. I really like the philosophy of our school; a more traditional style that promotes the values of respect and perseverance. Our master (Normand Théoret) and all the other Senseis have a passion for their art, which pushes us to surpass ourselves. The spirit of camaraderie is another reason why I'm still with the school after more than 20 years. My job: I'm a doctor. Other sports: badminton and jogging."

    - name: Sensei Stefan Savaria
      image: images/senseis/Stefan.jpg
      designation: Black belt, 1st dan
      content: I began my martial arts career at the Tae Kwon Do Chong Lee competition school. After a few years of competition, I took a break to practice other sports such as triathlon competition.  Having moved to Candiac, I saw that there was a karate school nearby and decided to obtain my black belt in order to teach martial arts.  What I particularly appreciate about this school is that the diversity of backgrounds of the different teachers means that you can acquire a wide range of skills and techniques from different martial arts, while remaining on a karate path.  I have also given several women's self-defence courses in Candiac..

      designation: Brown belt
      content: I decided to sign up for karate classes with the town of Candiac in order to get back into shape following my pregnancies. I've been practising this art for just over 11 years now, and it's still a great pleasure. I never thought I'd get a brown belt! I'm really proud of what I've achieved. The senseis and other karatekas have all supported and encouraged me along the way. As well as contributing to my physical and mental well-being, karate has a positive effect on my confidence and allows me to surpass myself. Today, I'm continuing my development by sharing the techniques I've been taught, while continuing to refine them myself!
